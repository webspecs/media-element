Introduction</span><a class=self-link href=#intro></a></h2>

<p>Call me Ishmael. The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. It
    was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. It was the best of times,
    it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the
    epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season
    of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. Stately, plump Buck
    Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay
    crossed.</p>

<p>One summer afternoon Mrs. Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put
    perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she
    supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who
    had once lost two million dollars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled
    enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary.</p>

  <h2 class="no-ref no-num heading settled" id=conformance><span class=content>Conformance</span><a class=self-link href=#conformance></a></h2>

  <p>
    Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and RFC 2119
    terminology. The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
    “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a data-biblio-type=normative data-link-type=biblio href=#biblio-rfc2119 title=RFC2119>[RFC2119]</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the text of this specification is normative except sections explicitly marked as
    non-normative, examples, and notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example” or are set apart from
    the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>, like this:
  </p>
  <div class=example>
    This is an example of an informative example.
  </div>
  <p>
    Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the normative text with
    <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
  </p>
  <p class=note>
    Note, this is an informative note.
